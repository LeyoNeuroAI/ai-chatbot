                            use it. If you use a Payment Method which you are not authorized to use, you will be liable to us for any

                            available to individuals, you must sign up for a subscription with us (a &quot;Subscription&quot;), first
                            by creating an Account and then following the subscription procedure on our Services. When you sign up for
                            a Subscription, you agree to these Terms.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            &quot;a. Subscription order.&quot; Your order for a Subscription constitutes an offer by you to enter into
                            a Subscription with us. We will confirm our acceptance of your order by sending you a confirmation email
                            (the &quot;Confirmation Email&quot;). Sometimes we reject orders, for example, if you are located in a
                            country where we do not offer the Service or the Service was mispriced by us. A contract for the
                            Subscription, which is on the basis of these Terms, will become legally binding on you and us when we send
                            you the Confirmation Email. For clarity, each Subscription will incorporate these Terms.

                            provided as part of your Subscription, and the duration of your Subscription, will be described in the
                            order process. We may change or refresh the content, features, and other services from time to time, and
                            we do not guarantee that any particular piece of content, feature, or other service will always be
                            available through the Services.

                            &quot;c. Subscription term and automatic renewal.&quot; If your Subscription has a minimum term (the
                            &quot;Initial Term&quot;), we will let you know during the order process. Your Subscription will last for
                            the Initial Term and will automatically renew for an additional term equal in duration to the Initial Term
                            and will continue to renew and incur charges for additional terms equal in duration to the Initial Term
                            (each such additional term, a &quot;Renewal Term&quot;). For example, if you subscribe on January 25th for
                            a Subscription with a one-month Initial Term, the Initial Term is January 25th to February 24th
                            (inclusive) and then Renewal Terms will run from the 25th of one month to the 24th of the next month
                            (inclusive).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            &quot;d. Subscription fees.&quot; You will pay the fees, either to us or to the App Distributor, for the
                            Initial Term and each subsequent Renewal Term up front at the start of that Initial Term or Renewal Term
                            (as applicable). We have the right to make changes to the fees applicable to your Subscription from time
                            to time, although we will not make any change to the fees applicable to your Subscription during the
                            current Initial Term or Renewal Term (as applicable). If these changes result in an increase in the fees
                            payable by you, we will inform you at least 30 days in advance of the change and you shall be deemed to
                            have agreed to the increase in fees payable by you unless you cancel the Subscription, as described in
                            Sections (e) and (g) below, before the Renewal Term to which the increase in fees will apply.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            &quot;e. Subscription cancellation.&quot; If you subscribed via our website, you may cancel your
                            Subscription at any time by using a method we may provide to you through our products (for example, in
                            your customer portal) or by notifying us at support@neurosecure.ai. If you subscribed via an app, you will
                            need to cancel via the distributor according to the App Distributor&apos;s terms. To avoid renewal and
                            charges for the next Renewal Term, cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before the last day of the
                            Initial Term or any Renewal Term. In the example above, if you subscribe on January 25th for a
                            Subscription that renews with a one-month Initial Term, you must cancel the Subscription per the
                            instructions by February 23rd (24 hours before February 24th) to avoid renewal and charges for the next
                            Renewal Term. In the event of a cancellation, your fees will not be refunded, but your access to the
                            Services will continue through the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term for which you previously
                            paid fees.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            &quot;f. Additional cancellation rights.&quot; You have a legal right to change your mind and cancel the
                            Subscription within 14 days of entering into the Subscription without giving a reason.
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                To exercise the right to cancel in the 14-day cancellation period, you must inform us of your decision
                                to cancel the Subscription by making a clear statement to us of such decision before the cancellation
                                period has expired. The easiest way to do this is by cancelling your subscription in the customer
                                portal, or you may contact us at support@neurosecure.ai. You may also use the model cancellation form in
                                Appendix 1 of these Terms, but it is not obligatory. For further details on how to cancel, please see
                                our support website. We will acknowledge your cancellation, e.g., through our online customer portal or
                                console.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you cancel the Subscription under Section 7(f)(1), we will reimburse you all payments received from
                                you for the cancelled Subscription. We will make the reimbursement without undue delay, and not later
                                than 14 days after the day on which we are informed about your decision to cancel the Subscription. We
                                will make the reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction; you
                                will not incur any fees as a result of the reimbursement.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you would like to use the Services during the 14-day cancellation period, you may do so. If you have
                                used the Services during the 14-day cancellation period, and wish to cancel the Subscription, you can
                                still do so by following the process in Section 7(f)(1) above, but we may retain an amount which is in
                                proportion to what has been provided until you have communicated us your withdrawal from these Terms, in
                                comparison with the full coverage of the Subscription.
                            </li>

                        <p>
                            &quot;g. Subscriptions purchased through an App Distributor.&quot; Where you have purchased your
                            Subscription through an App Distributor, your right to cancel under Section 7(f) above will be as set out
                            in the App Distributor&apos;s terms and Section 7(f) will not apply. The App Distributor&apos;s terms will
                            set out how to notify the App Distributor that you want to cancel and how any fees will be refunded.
                        </p>

                            &quot;Additional fees.&quot; We may also increase the fees for access to our Services that do not require
                            a Subscription. If we charge additional fees in connection with those Services, we will give you an
                            opportunity to review and accept the additional fees before you are charged. Also, additional fees may
                            apply for additional Services or features of the Services that we may make available. If you do not accept
                            any such additional fees, we may discontinue your access to those Services or features.

                            &quot;Changes to Services.&quot; Our Services are novel and will change. We may sometimes add or remove
                            features, increase or decrease capacity limits, offer new Services, or stop offering old ones. We may
                            modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services or your access to the Services. Where those actions will
                            materially impact your use of the Services, we will endeavor to notify you in accordance with this
                            section. This includes taking such action as we consider appropriate to address any security, performance
                            or trust and safety issue.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Where feasible, we will provide you with at least 30 days&apos; advance notice of any such changes to the
                            Services that would materially limit or reduce the features, availability or functionality of the
                            Services. However, there may be urgent situations (such as preventing abuse, responding to legal
                            requirements, or addressing security and operability issues) where providing advance notice is not
                            feasible.

                            If you do not wish to continue using the Services following material changes to the Services, please
                            cancel your Account (or the Subscription purchased via our website, if applicable) by notifying us at
                            support@neurosecure.ai and we will refund you a portion of the fees paid by you that are for the portion
                            of your Subscription purchased via our website remaining after termination of your Subscription occurs.
                            Any refunds for Subscriptions purchased via an App Distributor are subject to the App Distributor&apos;s
                            terms and not these Terms.

                            &quot;Changes to these Terms.&quot; We may revise and update these Terms. For example, we may update these
                            Terms (1) to reflect changes in our Services, like when we add or remove features or services, or update
                            our pricing, (2) for security or legal reasons, or (3) to promote safety or prevent abuse. We will notify
                            you of changes to the Terms which are reasonably likely to affect your use of the Services or legal
                            rights. These changes will come into effect no less than 30 days from when we notify you, unless the
                            change is due to a change in law or for security reasons (in which case we may need to change the Terms on
                            shorter notice).
                        </p>

                            If you do not wish to continue using our Services following any changes to the Terms you can terminate
                            these Terms (or a Subscription purchased via our website) by notifying us at support@neurosecure.ai,
                            before the changes take effect. If you exercise this termination right, we will refund to you a portion of
                            the fees paid by you that are for the portion of your Subscription purchased via our website remaining
                            after termination of your Subscription occurs. Any refunds for Subscriptions purchased via an App
                            Distributor are subject to the App Distributor&apos;s terms and not these Terms.

                            &quot;Supplemental Terms.&quot; We may also post supplemental terms. We may offer new Services or features
                            that we believe require service-specific terms or guidelines. If you decide to use those new Services or
                            features, you agree to comply with any applicable guidelines, rules, or supplemental terms that may be
                            posted on the Services from time to time (&quot;Supplemental Terms&quot;). If these Terms conflict with
                            Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms will govern for the applicable Service.

                            &quot;Termination.&quot; You may stop accessing the Services at any time. We may suspend or terminate your
                            access to the Services at any time without notice to you if:
                        </p>

                            <li>we must do so in order to comply with applicable law; or</li>
                            <li>
                                immediate suspension or termination is necessary for security reasons and therefore we cannot provide
                                notice.
                            </li>

                        <p>
                            We may also terminate your Account if you have been inactive for over a year and you do not have a paid
                            Account. If we decide to terminate your Account due to inactivity, we will give you advance notice before
                            doing this.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If we terminate your access to the Services due to a material breach of these Terms and you have a

                            <li>
                                we may take further legal action against you and you may be responsible for our losses in relation to
                                the violation of these Terms.
                            </li>

                        <p>
                            If you have a Subscription, we may terminate the Subscription at any time by giving you at least 30
                            days&apos; notice in writing (email is sufficient). If we exercise this right, we will refund you on a pro
                            rata basis the fees paid by you for the remaining portion of your Subscription after termination.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Upon termination of these Terms, a Subscription, or your access to the Services, the rights granted to you
                            under our Terms (or any Subscription) to access and use our Services will immediately terminate, and we
                            may at our option delete any Materials or other data associated with your account. Sections 7 (with
                            respect to fees outstanding as of such expiration or termination) and 8 â€“ 11 will survive any expiration
                            or termination of our Terms or a Subscription.
                        </p>

                            &quot;Severability.&quot; Each of the sections of these Terms operates separately. If any court or
                            relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining sections will
                            remain in full force and effect.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            &quot;No waiver.&quot; If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or
                            if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have
                            waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If
                            we waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will
                            automatically waive any later default by you.
                        </p>

                            &quot;No assignment.&quot; These Terms may not be transferred or assigned by you without our prior written
                            consent, but may be assigned by us without restriction.
